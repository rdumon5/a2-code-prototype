 # Overview
  Welcome to my code prototype created using Microsoft's MakeCode Arcade. This game addresses the      project challenge of environmental conservation, including littering and its impact on wildlife.       Within the game, the player controls a hero sprite that must collect as much rubbish possible       before a bird can pick it up. Along the way, the player faces challenges and must act quickly to gather as much trash as possible within a limited time.
# Game Description 
## Objective
  The objective of the game is to gather as much rubbish as you can in the given thirty-second time frame. However, all throughout the game, there is a bird who is attempting to pick up the rubbish before you do. You lose a life if the bird gets the garbage first!Â 
## Technologies Used
 - Microsoft MakeCode Arcade
## Features
- Randomized Trash: Every time the player collects the trash, a new piece is randomly spawned on the screen to keep the game fresh and unpredictable.
- Time-Limit to Gameplay: The player has 30 seconds to collect as much trash as possible 
- Overlap functions: The game handles various collisions, such as:
  - Player collects trash.
  - Bird collects trash.
  - Hero and bird overlap (with no impact on gameplay).
